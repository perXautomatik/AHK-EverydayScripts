ahk framework to trigger popup actions on windows focus,

    for example, starting princess conuest, open save repo

    open todo

    and not just open, focus if already opened


also allow finegrained filtering, by wildcard or by other things such as

    if window x is not opened etc.


this would allow workspace resuming to be very easy.
