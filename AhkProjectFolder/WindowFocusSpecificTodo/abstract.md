ahk framework to trigger popup actions on windows focus,

    * for example, starting princess conuest, open save repo

    open todo

    and not just open, focus if already opened


* also allow finegrained filtering, by wildcard or by other things such as

    if window x is not opened etc.


this would allow workspace resuming to be very easy.


* look for folder with pattern simplification name,

    in folder, look for folder called todo, then open according to general rule.
